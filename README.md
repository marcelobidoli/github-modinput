# Github Modular Input

Forked from [https://github.com/splunk/splunk-sdk-javascript/tree/develop/examples/modularinputs/github_commits](https://github.com/splunk/splunk-sdk-javascript/tree/develop/examples/modularinputs/github_commits)

The Github Modular Input is a splunk modular input developed as an example in the [Splunk SDK for Javascript](https://github.com/splunk/splunk-sdk-javascript) and is bundled separately here with its dependencies for easy deployment to [Splunkbase](http://apps.splunk.com). It provides a "native" Splunk input method that collects commit data via the Github API to be consumed in Splunk for search, analysis and correlation with other data sets.

There is a very thorough blog post about how it is implemented at [blog.splunk.com](http://blogs.splunk.com/2014/09/17/new-support-for-authoring-modular-inputs-in-node-js/) as well as extensive documentation about its components which is referenced below.

## Install

In general there are two methods for installing apps into Splunk:

1. Copy this whole `github-modinput` folder to `$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps`.
2. Restart Splunk

or

1. From the App dropdown menu in your Splunk interface, click on "Find More Apps"
2. Search for "Github Modular Input" and follow the instructions to install. 

## Adding an input

1. From Splunk Home, click the Settings menu. Under **Data**, click **Data inputs**, and find `Github Commits`, the input you just added. **Click Add new on that row**.
2. Click **Add new** and fill in:
    * `name` (whatever name you want to give this input)
    * `owner` (the owner of the Github repository, this is a Github username or org name)
    * `repository` (the name of the Github repository)
    * (optional) `token` if using a private repository and/or to avoid Github's API limits. To get a Github API token visit the [Github settings page](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) and make sure the `repo` and `public_repo` scopes are selected.
3. Save your input, and navigate back to Splunk Home.
4. Do a search for `sourcetype=github_commits` and you should see some commits indexed, if your repository has a large number of commits indexing them may take a few moments.
